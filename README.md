This project is a sample of using awsspec and terragrunt to have more Behavior Driven Design (BDD) with
your terraform projects.  

It currently uses terragrunt and awspec.  In the future terragrunt may be removed, and will likely be driven
by kitchen terraform with a kitchen-verifier-awspect provider
